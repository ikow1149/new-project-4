        Out of hundreds of job applications we receive, our Human Resource panel selects the very best as teachers for our schools from the most eligible candidates. We take pride in the fact that so many qualified educators from around the world wish to be part of our team.

        WHAT MGM REQUIRES?
        Our teachers and administrative staff are qualified professionals passionate about the vision of MGM. Our teachers must love their job and love their students even more. A candidate who seeks to work with us for the cause must be able to see more in a child than themselves. We are on the lookout for forward-thinking experts with a passion to teach little children like their own. If that sounds like you, share your experience with us by sending us your data. Simply fill the Career Form or meet us at a recruitment event. You can also directly contact us at our corporate office or the local school. A personal meeting can then be scheduled for further evaluation and assessment. We will also determine whether your profile matches a different role, and will check with you to see if you would like to be considered for roles different than the one you applied. If interested, an interview can be scheduled.

        We will always keep your experience in mind for future roles (as long as you want us to!).

        NOTE:
        We do not work with recruitment agencies or agents and will not accept any monetary gifts to place you in our institution. Always make sure you are dealing with the real MGM Corporate Office when applying for a job with us.

        ANY CONCERNS, PLEASE CONTACT US:
